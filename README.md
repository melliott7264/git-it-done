# <Git It Done>

## Description

This application is to be an interface with GitHub to find open source projects to which to contribute.

- This project is a collaboration with a developer who is providing the HTML and CSS.  I will provide the JavaScript.
- This project makes it easier to match open source project issues with developers with the skills to close them.
- In the process I will enhance my JavaScript skills and get an introduction to server-side APIs.


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
